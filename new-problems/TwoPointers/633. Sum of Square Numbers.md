# 633. Sum of Square Numbers

**LeetCode:** {https://leetcode.com/problems/sum-of-square-numbers/description/?envType=company&envId=two-sigma&favoriteSlug=two-sigma-all}  
**Date:** {2026-01-19}  
**Status:** ✅ Solved
**Difficulty:** Medium  
**Tags/Pattern:** two pointers
**Time/Space:** O(sqrt(c)) / O(1)

## 1) Problem in 1 line

finding 2 numbers whos squares sum will be equal to input if so return true else false
Explain the problem in one sentence.

---

## 2) My first thought (before coding)

i did c//2 and thought of using for loop to traverse through 0 to c//2+1
What I tried first, and why.

---

## 3) Mistakes / Confusions (Error Notebook 핵심)

- Mistake #1: should use pointers
- Mistake #2: than //2 sqrt is better and avoids TLE
- What I learned:
  sqrt; floor(sqrt(c)) - floor rounds of the squareroot
  TAKING HINTS AND SEEING TOPICS HELPED!!

---

## 4) Final approach (in plain English)

take squareroot of the number
pointers l=0, r=floor(sqrt(c))
if c==0 or c==1 return true
while loop l<=r:
take curr_sum then based on it move the two pointers based on if else conditions
Steps of the solution like you’d explain to a friend.

## 5) Code (final)

```python
class Solution:
    def judgeSquareSum(self, c: int) -> bool:
        maxNum=floor(sqrt(c))
        l=0
        r=maxNum
        if c==0 or c==1:
            return True
        while l<=r:
            curr_sum=(l*l)+(r*r)
            if curr_sum==c:
                return True
            elif curr_sum<c:
                l+=1
            else:
                r-=1
        return False
