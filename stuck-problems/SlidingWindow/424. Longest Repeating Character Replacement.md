# 424. Longest Repeating Character Replacement

**LeetCode:** {[Link](https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-repeating-character-replacement/description/)}  
**Date:** {2026-01-19}  
**Status:** ❌ Stuck / 🔁 Redo  
**Difficulty:** Medium  
**Tags/Pattern:** sliding window
**Time/Space:** O(n) / O(n)

## 1) Problem in 1 line

find length of longest substring based on k
Explain the problem in one sentence.

---

## 2) My first thought (before coding)

i thought of using set but discarded as repetition was okay
thought of taking res for max length
no more ideas sadly
What I tried first, and why.

---

## 3) Mistakes / Confusions (Error Notebook 핵심)

- Mistake #1: did not think of dictionary as frequency is involved: calculate max frequency
- Mistake #2: did not think of using length - max_count >k to remove elements from left side
- What I learned:
  frequency involved -> use dictionary
  calculate max_count to know when to decrease the size of the sliding window

---

## 4) Final approach (in plain English)

take res=0, l=0, count={}
for loop for r in range(len(s))
in for loop increment the frequenceies in count
calculate max_count based on max_count and s[r]
now if while (r-l+1) - max_count>k then decrease window size and increment l
calculate max res in for loop end
return res

Steps of the solution like you’d explain to a friend.

## 5) Code (final)

```python
class Solution:
    def characterReplacement(self, s: str, k: int) -> int:
        res=0
        l=0
        count={}
        max_count=0
        for r in range(len(s)):
            if s[r] not in count:
                count[s[r]]=1
            else:
                count[s[r]]+=1
            max_count=max(max_count, count[s[r]])
            while (r-l+1) - max_count>k:
                count[s[l]]-=1
                l+=1
            res=max(res, r-l+1)
        return res
