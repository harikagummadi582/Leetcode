## 1) Problem in 1 line

- you have to be able to travel with gas you are able to get - cost to get the gas and see if it is positive to move forward but overal gain when going through indexes should be positive
  Explain the problem in one sentence.

---

## 2) My first thought (before coding)

- no freaking idea
  What I tried first, and why.

---

## 3) Mistakes / Confusions (Error Notebook 핵심)

- Mistake #1: trying to get best possible approach so greedy is a sign
- What I learned:
- track present gain and tot gain as required so reverse engineer the problems like what they are asking and what should you consider

---

## 4) Final approach (in plain English)

- First check if the total gas is enough to cover the total cost.
- If total gas is less than cost, completing the circle is impossible.
- Move through each station and keep adding the gas difference to your tank.
- If the tank becomes negative, you cannot start from this station.
- Reset the tank to zero and set the next station as the new start.
- Continue scanning forward only once through all stations.
- If total gas is non-negative, the last start index will work.
- Otherwise, return -1.

Steps of the solution like you’d explain to a friend.

## 5) Code (final)

```python
class Solution:
    def canCompleteCircuit(self, gas: List[int], cost: List[int]) -> int:
        tot_gain=0
        curr_gain=0
        answer=0
        for i in range(len(gas)):
            curr_gain+=gas[i]-cost[i]
            tot_gain+=gas[i]-cost[i]

            if curr_gain<0:
                answer=i+1
                curr_gain=0
        return answer if tot_gain>=0 else -1
# paste final accepted code here
```
