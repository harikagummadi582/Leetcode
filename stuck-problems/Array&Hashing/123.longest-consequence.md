## 1) Problem in 1 line

find th elongest consequence in the given input array
Explain the problem in one sentence.

---

## 2) My first thought (before coding)

to use set, use variable count and max_count to find the longest consequence
to see if num-1 is in set then use while to find consequetive numbers
What I tried first, and why.

---

## 3) Mistakes / Confusions (Error Notebook 핵심)

- Mistake #1: to iterate over array than set formed which is better to avoid duplicates
- Mistake #2: thought of appending elements in array to form set
  -Mistake #3: was tracking backwards to find consequtive elements
- What I learned:
  to traverse over a set
  to form set directly - nums_set=set(nums) where nums is the array
  to start tracking consequtives by checking if num -1 not in set then assign length =1 and use while with num+length in set

---

## 4) Final approach (in plain English)

create a set directly from the array
create length=0, longest=0
for loop to traverse over the set
now check if prev element does not exist in set
if doesnt, then assign length =1
now use while loop to check if num+length in set if yes increase length+=1 not then track longest=max(longest,length)
return longest
Steps of the solution like you’d explain to a friend.

## 5) Code (final)

```python
class Solution:
    def longestConsecutive(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        nums_set=set(nums)
        count=0
        longest=0
        for num in nums_set: #iterate over set to avoid duplicates
            if num-1 not in nums_set: #to start sequence with the first element
                length=1
                while num+length in nums_set: #using length to find consequtive numbers
                    length+=1
                longest=max(longest, length)
        return longest
