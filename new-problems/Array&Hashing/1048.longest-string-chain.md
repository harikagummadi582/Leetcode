# 1048. Longest String Chain

**LeetCode:** {https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-string-chain/description/?envType=company&envId=two-sigma&favoriteSlug=two-sigma-all}  
**Date:** {2026-01-15}  
**Status:** ❌ Stuck
**Difficulty:** Medium  
**Tags/Pattern:** {e.g., Hashing, Set, dp}  
**Time/Space:** O(n · L²) / O(n)  
For each of the n words, we create up to L shorter words, and since creating each one takes O(L) time, the total time complexity is O(n · L²).

## 1) Problem in 1 line

each prev word should be predecssor of next word if one character can be inserted in predec anywhere without changing order of characters in predec will be equal to next word. we should find count of longest chain formed like that
Explain the problem in one sentence.

## 2) My first thought (before coding)

i had no clue
What I tried first, and why.

## 3) Mistakes / Confusions (Error Notebook 핵심)

- Mistake #1:
- Mistake #2:
- What I learned:
  DP is used - We store the longest chain length for each word so that when a longer word needs it, we reuse that stored result instead of recomputing it.

---

## 4) Final approach (in plain English)

sort words array, take best=1 to track longest string chain, dp={} (create dict)
for word in words loop assign dp[word]=1 because itself counts
for next for loop inside the above for loop slice the words to form different words and see if that is in dp already if so find max of dp[word] and dp[pred]+1 and store in best (best max is calculated outside second for loop)
return best
Steps of the solution like you’d explain to a friend.

## 5) Code (final)

```python
from typing import List
class Solution:
    def longestStrChain(self, words: List[str]) -> int:
        words.sort(key=len)
        dp={} #dict
        best=1
        for word in words:
            dp[word]=1 #word itself
            for i in range(len(word)):
                pred= word[:i]+word[i+1:]
                if pred in dp:
                    dp[word]=max(dp[word], dp[pred]+1)
            best=max(best, dp[word])
        return best
