# 20. Valid Parentheses

**LeetCode:** {https://leetcode.com/problems/valid-parentheses/description/}  
**Date:** {2026-01-21}  
**Status:** ❌ Stuck / 🔁 Redo  
**Difficulty:** Easy
**Tags/Pattern:** stack  
**Time/Space:** O(n) / O(n)

## 1) Problem in 1 line

find if opening and closing brackets are in order
Explain the problem in one sentence.

---

## 2) My first thought (before coding)

took map, stack and for loop and checked if stack is empty at the end then its true
What I tried first, and why.

---

## 3) Mistakes / Confusions (Error Notebook 핵심)

- Mistake #1: what if there are only closing brackets- did not think of this case- couldnt solve this
- What I learned: if its closing bracket check if stack is empty then if it is return false because there are no opening brackets in the stack anyways to verify

---

## 4) Final approach (in plain English)

- take map with brackets
- define stack
- for loop for each char in s
- in for loop if opening bracket append to stack
- in for loop else (closing bracket scenario) there are two ifs, first if to check if stack is empty then return false one more if to verify logic
- return true if stack is empty after for loop
  Steps of the solution like you’d explain to a friend.

## 5) Code (final)

```python
class Solution:
    def isValid(self, s: str) -> bool:
        bracket_map={'(':')', '{':'}','[':']'}
        stack=[]
        for char in s:
            if char in bracket_map:
                stack.append(char)
            else:
                if not stack:
                    return False
                if bracket_map[stack.pop()]!=char:
                    return False
        if not stack:
            return True
        else:
            return False
