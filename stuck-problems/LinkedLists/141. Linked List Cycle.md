# 141. Linked List Cycle

**LeetCode:** {https://leetcode.com/problems/linked-list-cycle/description/}

**Difficulty:** Easy
**Tags/Pattern:** {linked lists}  
**Time/Space:** O(n) / O(1)

## 1) Problem in 1 line

you have to find if there exists a cycle in the linked list
Explain the problem in one sentence.

---

## 2) My first thought (before coding)

i have to take two pointers slow, fast and have while loop and check if slow==fast to return true else false
What I tried first, and why.

---

## 3) Mistakes / Confusions (Error Notebook 핵심)

- Mistake #1: there should not be any else, return false should be outside the while loop
- Mistake #2: while condition is wrong there should be check of fast and fast.next not fast.next, fast.next.next because head might not exist so fast check is important
- What I learned:
- edge case if head is none should be checked
- return False scenario should be paid attention

---

## 4) Final approach (in plain English)

take slow and fast pointers, while loop to check cycle, if slow==fast in while loop return true else return false outside the loop
Steps of the solution like you’d explain to a friend.

## 5) Code (final)

```python
# Definition for singly-linked list.
# class ListNode:
#     def __init__(self, x):
#         self.val = x
#         self.next = None

class Solution:
    def hasCycle(self, head: Optional[ListNode]) -> bool:
        slow=head
        fast=head
        while fast and fast.next:
            slow=slow.next
            fast=fast.next.next
            if slow==fast:
                return True
        return False
