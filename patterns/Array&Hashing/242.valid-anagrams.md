**Date:** {2026-01-14}

## 1) Problem in 1 line

if the first string is rearranged in any manner it should be same as the second string. In short the frequency of each character in both the strings should be same
Explain the problem in one sentence.

---

## 2) My first thought (before coding)

i can create a map but didnt know how to maintain frequencies
What I tried first, and why.

---

## 3) Mistakes / Confusions (Error Notebook)

- Mistake #1: did not know about counter which can be imported to use ord for ASCII values of the alphabets
- Mistake #2: did not know we can access indexes in both the strings in one for loop
- What I learned:
  usage of ord, can traverse through both strings

---

## 4) Final approach (in plain English)

create a count array with 26 indices having 0 as a value
now if the length of both the strings are not same return false
create a for loop to traverse through both strings. for i in range(len(eith of the string))
add +1 to the indices where ord(char)-ord('a') in one string and do -1 in other string so the total count at the end in the count array becomes 0 if not they are not valid anagrams

Steps of the solution like you’d explain to a friend.

## 5) Code (final)

```python
from collections import Counter
class Solution:
    def isAnagram(self, s: str, t: str) -> bool:
        count=[0]*26
        if len(s)!=len(t):
            return False
        for i in range(len(s)):
            count[ord(s[i])-ord('a')]+=1
            count[ord(t[i])-ord('a')]-=1
        return all(c==0 for c in count)
# paste final accepted code here
```
