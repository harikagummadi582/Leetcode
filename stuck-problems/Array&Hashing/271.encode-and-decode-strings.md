## 1) Problem in 1 line

there is list of strings given and we have to encode and decode each string in the list and return output as input
Explain the problem in one sentence.

---

## 2) My first thought (before coding)

no idea though i did this 10 days back
i did not get idea of tracking len of each string, # and appending the word to decode it later
What I tried first, and why.

---

## 3) Mistakes / Confusions (Error Notebook 핵심)

- Mistake #1: did not see what input and output are named as and their formats
- Mistake #2: did not get the idea of how to encode and decode
- What I learned:
  i should pay more attention to input and output formats
  remember the pattern for encode and decode problems

---

## 4) Final approach (in plain English)

take an empty string
write for loop to track len of each string in the list of strings, #, string itself to be added to the empty string
above step to decode it later using pointers
in the decode function- take two pointers and while to traverse through string formed in encode function
first pointer i to track len of whole encoded string, second pointer j to see where # is
when you find #, get length using s[i:j]
then update i and j to get \word out; like i=j+1, j=i+1ength now get the word out by int(s[i:j])
now make i=j for next word
add this word to res array defined at the beginning of the decoding problem
Steps of the solution like you’d explain to a friend.

## 5) Code (final)

```python
class Codec:
    def encode(self, strs: List[str]) -> str:
        """Encodes a list of strings to a single string.
        """
        res=""
        for word in strs:
            res+=str(len(word))+"#"+word
        return res

    def decode(self, s: str) -> List[str]:
        """Decodes a single string to a list of strings.
        """
        i=0
        res=[] #array to get the output out
        while i<len(s):
            j=i
            while s[j]!="#":
                j=j+1
            length=int(s[i:j])
            i=j+1
            j=length+i
            res.append(s[i:j])
            i=j
        return res
# paste final accepted code here
```
