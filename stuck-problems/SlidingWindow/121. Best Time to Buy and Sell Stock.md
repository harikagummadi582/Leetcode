## 1) Problem in 1 line

finding the max profit based on buy and sell days prices
Explain the problem in one sentence.

---

## 2) My first thought (before coding)

i thought of using pointers but it did not work
What I tried first, and why.

---

## 3) Mistakes / Confusions (Error Notebook 핵심)

- Mistake #1: you need to track min price - missed this
- What I learned:
  track min prices with curr element and min price defined as first element of the array for reference

---

## 4) Final approach (in plain English)

define finalminprice =prices[0]
define max_profit
use for loop over the array
track minprice between current ele and min price defined
calculate curr profit with prices[i]-finalminprice
calculate maxprofit for every iteration
return max profit
Steps of the solution like you’d explain to a friend.

## 5) Code (final)

class Solution:
def maxProfit(self, prices: List[int]) -> int:
max_profit=0
finalMinPrice=prices[0]
for i in range(len(prices)):
finalMinPrice=min(prices[i], finalMinPrice)
curr_profit=prices[i]-finalMinPrice
max_profit=max(max_profit,curr_profit)

        return max_profit

```python
