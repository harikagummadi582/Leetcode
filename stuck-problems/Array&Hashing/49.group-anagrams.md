## 1) Problem in 1 line

they anagrams should me kept in one list and list of these lists should be returned
Explain the problem in one sentence.

---

## 2) My first thought (before coding)

i did not know how to pair up the anagrams, thought of sorting but did not know syntax to sort a string
What I tried first, and why.

---

## 3) Mistakes / Confusions (Error Notebook 핵심)

- Mistake #1: syntax to sort a string not known
- Mistake #2: sorting each word in string to map it to keys which are sorted words if key not present create one for this new one
- Mistake #3: did not know how to return list of map values
- What I learned:
  sort string - sorted_word=''.join(sorted(word))
  list of map values - list(char_map.values())

---

## 4) Final approach (in plain English)

create a char map
create a for loop to traverse through each word
in for loop sort each word and check if it exists in char map assign the original word to the sorted key word in map
else create [] for the new key word and append original word as value
return list of char map values as output
Steps of the solution like you’d explain to a friend.

## 5) Code (final)

```python
class Solution:
    def groupAnagrams(self, strs: List[str]) -> List[List[str]]:
        char_map={}
        for word in strs:
            sorted_word=' '.join(sorted(word))
            if sorted_word not in char_map:
                char_map[sorted_word]=[]
                char_map[sorted_word].append(word)
            else:
                char_map[sorted_word].append(word)
        return list(char_map.values())
