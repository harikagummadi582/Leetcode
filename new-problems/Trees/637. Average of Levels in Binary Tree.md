## 1) Problem in 1 line

find the average of nodes at each level and add the answer to a list to return it
Explain the problem in one sentence.

## 2) My first thought (before coding)

dfs, helper function, depth and track res but sum and counts didnt strike
What I tried first, and why.

## 3) Mistakes / Confusions (Error Notebook 핵심)

- Mistake #1: mixed values and structure by treating res[depth] sometimes as a value and sometimes as a list.
- never initialized a level container (res.append([])), but tried to assign into res[depth].
- used // for averaging, which floors decimals and breaks average calculations.
- compared with root.val, which is unrelated to level-wise averaging logic.
- tried to compute averages incrementally without tracking both sum and count.
- updated only when len(res) == depth, ignoring nodes when the level already exists.

- What I learned:
- Decide the data shape first (list of sums, counts, or values) and keep it consistent.
- Always initialize level storage before updating it in DFS/BFS.
- Averages require /, not //, and need sum + count.
- Level-based problems should not rely on root comparisons.
- Track what you need explicitly (sum and count) instead of guessing math updates.
- Handle both “new level” and “existing level” cases.

---

## 4) Final approach (in plain English)

- If the tree is empty, there’s nothing to average, so we stop early.
- We start with a queue containing the root, because we want to process the tree level by level.
- For each level, we count how many nodes are there and add up their values.
- While doing that, we push each node’s children into the queue for the next level.
- Once the level is done, we divide the sum by the number of nodes to get the average.
- We repeat this until the queue is empty, meaning all levels are processed.
  Steps of the solution like you’d explain to a friend.

## 5) Code (final)

```python
# Definition for a binary tree node.
# class TreeNode:
#     def __init__(self, val=0, left=None, right=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.left = left
#         self.right = right
class Solution:
    def averageOfLevels(self, root: Optional[TreeNode]) -> List[float]:

        #its bfs so why am i thinking in dfs terms

        if not root:
            return
        queue=deque([root])
        res=[]
        while queue:
            level_size=len(queue)
            level_sum=0
            for _ in range(level_size):
                node=queue.popleft()
                level_sum+=node.val
                if node.left:
                    queue.append(node.left)
                if node.right:
                    queue.append(node.right)
            res.append(level_sum/level_size)
        return res
# paste final accepted code here
```
