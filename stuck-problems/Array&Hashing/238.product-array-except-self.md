## 1) Problem in 1 line

return an array with each element being product of other elements than itself
Explain the problem in one sentence.

## 2) My first thought (before coding)

i thought of using pointers going forward to calculate but it clicked i would loose original elements values in such a way. i knew i had to use prefix but suffix did not cross my mind. i did not think of using extra array
What I tried first, and why.

## 3) Mistakes / Confusions (Error Notebook 핵심)

- Mistake #1: pointers usage nor relatable
- Mistake #2: not knowing how for loop from back works in python
- What I learned:
  that it is prefix suffix problem
  i should use seperate array to store the prefix using one for loop
  then suffix with other for loop
  for loop from back - for i in range(n-1,-1,-1):

---

## 4) Final approach (in plain English)

find length of input array
take one final array with elemets as 1 multiplied length of input array
first for loop from start for prefix
first for loop - take prefix as 1, place it as first element in final array, multiple each element with prefix and place it in ith index as second step
second for loop from end for suffix
second for loop - take suffix as 1, update final array with suffix\*finalarray[i], then update suffix with multiplying suffix with current index in input array (you will figure it out with example how to write manipulations in for loops- this helped to solve it on my own)
return final array
Steps of the solution like you’d explain to a friend.

## 5) Code (final)

```python
class Solution:
    def productExceptSelf(self, nums: List[int]) -> List[int]:
        n=len(nums)
        answer=[1]*n
        prefix=1
        for i in range(n):
            answer[i]=prefix
            prefix=prefix*nums[i]
        suffix=1
        for i in range(n-1,-1,-1):
            answer[i]=suffix*answer[i]
            suffix=suffix*nums[i]
        return answer
