# 143. Reorder List

**LeetCode:** {https://leetcode.com/problems/reorder-list/description/}  
**Date:** {2026-01-22}  
**Status:** ❌ Stuck / 🔁 Redo  
**Difficulty:** Medium  
**Tags/Pattern:** {linked lists}  
**Time/Space:** O(n) / O(1)

## 1) Problem in 1 line

the nodes should be kept in alternate way
Explain the problem in one sentence.

---

## 2) My first thought (before coding)

take slow and fast pointers thats it
What I tried first, and why.

---

## 3) Mistakes / Confusions (Error Notebook 핵심)

- Mistake #1: thought-divide the list into half and break it, reverse last half and traverse together
- Mistake #2:slow.next=None to break the list
- Mistake #3: take first =head, second=prev, taking tmp1, tmp2 variables to save to be changed nodes and use while second as it is the smaller list
- What I learned:
  glimpse the approach and try to do it on your own to know where you getting stuck

---

## 4) Final approach (in plain English)

divide the list into half and break it, reverse last half and traverse together
Steps of the solution like you’d explain to a friend.

---

## 5) Code (final)

```python
# Definition for singly-linked list.
# class ListNode:
#     def __init__(self, val=0, next=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.next = next
class Solution:
    def reorderList(self, head: Optional[ListNode]) -> None:

        """
        Do not return anything, modify head in-place instead.
        """
        if not head or not head.next:
            return head
        prev=None
        slow=head
        fast=head
        while fast and fast.next:
            slow=slow.next
            fast=fast.next.next
        curr=slow.next#3 !!!
        slow.next=None #cut the list into half   !!!
        while curr:
            nxt=curr.next #4
            curr.next=prev
            prev=curr
            curr=nxt
        first=head #1
        second=prev #5
        while second:
            tmp1=first.next #2 !!!
            tmp2=second.next #4 !!!
            first.next=second #1->5
            second.next=tmp1 #5->2
            first=tmp1
            second=tmp2
        return head
# paste final accepted code here
```
