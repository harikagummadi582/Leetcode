# 3. Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters

**LeetCode:** {https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-substring-without-repeating-characters/description/}  
**Date:** {2026-01-19}  
**Status:** ❌ Stuck / 🔁 Redo  
**Difficulty:** Medium  
**Tags/Pattern:** sliding window
**Time/Space:** O(n) / O(min(n,k)) k=min unique chars to store in char_set

---

## 1) Problem in 1 line

find the longest substring without repeating characters so repeating chars can be anywhere in the window
Explain the problem in one sentence.

---

## 2) My first thought (before coding)

i used left and right in while loop to track but logic was not working
What I tried first, and why.

---

## 3) Mistakes / Confusions (Error Notebook 핵심)

- Mistake #1: for loop for r and use while loop to avoid duplicates in the current window
- What I learned:
  think of mix of while and for

---

## 4) Final approach (in plain English)

initialise left=0, res=0, char_set
for loop for r in s
while s[r] in char_set decrease the window size by removing s[l] from charset and increment l
every iteration add s[r] to set and calculate max of res and current window=r-l+1
return res
Steps of the solution like you’d explain to a friend.

## 5) Code (final)

```python
class Solution:
    def lengthOfLongestSubstring(self, s: str) -> int:
        char_set=set()
        left=0
        res=0
        for r in range(len(s)):
            while s[r] in char_set: #to avoid duplicates throughout
                char_set.remove(s[left])
                left+=1
            char_set.add(s[r])
            res=max(res, r-left+1)
        return res
