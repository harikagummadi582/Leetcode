# 11. Container With Most Water

**LeetCode:** https://leetcode.com/problems/container-with-most-water/description/
**Date:** 2026-01-19, 2026-02-05
**Status:** solved
**Difficulty:** Medium
**Tags/Pattern:** two pointers
**Time/Space:** O(n) / O(1)

## 1) Problem in 1 line

find the max area without height coordinates being slant
Explain the problem in one sentence.

---

## 2) My first thought (before coding)

- knew i had to consider min of height to cal area and width is dependent on the pointers
  taking maxarea, width, define left and right pointers, find max area using pointers and while loop
  What I tried first, and why.

---

## 3) Mistakes / Confusions (Error Notebook 핵심)

- Mistake #1: i did not think of moving pointers based on optimal height i would get by comparing height[left], height[right]
- What I learned:
  move pointers based on the problem given and think in a way of how do you get optimised solution

---

## 4) Final approach (in plain English)

take the variables as mentioned above
calculate curr area and max area at ever point and return max area at the end

Steps of the solution like you’d explain to a friend.

## 5) Code (final)

```python
class Solution:
    def maxArea(self, height: List[int]) -> int:
        max_area=float('-inf')
        l=0
        r=len(height)-1
        while l<r:
            width=r-l
            heightt=min(height[l], height[r])
            area=width*heightt
            max_area=max(max_area, area)
            if height[l]<height[r]:
                l+=1
            else:
                r-=1
        return max_area
```

```python
class Solution:
    def maxArea(self, height: List[int]) -> int:
        max_area=0
        width=0
        left=0
        right=len(height)-1
        while left<right:
            heightt=min(height[left], height[right])
            width=right-left
            curr_area=heightt*width
            max_area=max(max_area,curr_area)
            if height[left]<height[right]:
                left+=1
            else:
                right-=1
        return max_area
