# 3417. Zigzag Grid Traversal With Skip

**LeetCode:** {https://leetcode.com/problems/zigzag-grid-traversal-with-skip/description/}  
**Date:** {2026-01-29}  
**Status:** ❌ Stuck / 🔁 Redo  
**Difficulty:** Easy
**Tags/Pattern:** {array matrix}  
**Time/Space:** O(n^2) / O(n)

## 1) Problem in 1 line

take alternate elements, change direction for each row
Explain the problem in one sentence.

---

## 2) My first thought (before coding)

take a variable to change direction
What I tried first, and why.

---

## 3) Mistakes / Confusions (Error Notebook 핵심)

- Mistake #1: did not notice m,n can be any number thought it would be 2x2 matrix
- Mistake #2: did not know we can flip direction by changing second for loop
- What I learned:
- even rows left to right, odd rows right to left
- cols= range(n) if i%2==0 else range(n-1,-1,-1)

---

## 4) Final approach (in plain English)

- take array res=[]
- find rows, cols value
- take variable take as true
- for loop to go through rows second for loop but find range of second for loop based on even or odd row
- if take append element after if shift value of take to skip next element
- return res
  Steps of the solution like you’d explain to a friend.

## 5) Code (final)

```python
class Solution:
    def zigzagTraversal(self, grid: List[List[int]]) -> List[int]:
        m=len(grid)
        n=len(grid[0])
        take=True
        res=[]
        for i in range(m):
            cols= range (n) if i%2==0 else range(n-1,-1,-1)
            for j in cols:
                if take:
                    res.append(grid[i][j])
                take= not take
        return res

```
