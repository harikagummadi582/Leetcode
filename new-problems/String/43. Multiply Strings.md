## 1) Problem in 1 line

find the product of two strings without using builtin math functions
Explain the problem in one sentence.

---

## 2) My first thought (before coding)

i wanted to use build in functions; had an idea to use carry but wasnt sure how
What I tried first, and why.

---

## 3) Mistakes / Confusions (Error Notebook 핵심)

- Mistake #1:
- Mistake #2:
- What I learned:
- %10 to find last digit
- //10 to find the carry
- to reverse numbers in string num1[::-1]
- return "".join(str(digit) for digit in reversed(array))

---

## 4) Final approach (in plain English)

- if numbers are 0 return 0
- create an array to store digits multiplcation from two numbers. len of array being sum of len of numbers and initialize values to 0
- reverse the numbers
- use place1, digit 1 for first number and similarly for second number
- take nested loops with outer loop for second number, inner loop for first number
- in the loops sum of place1 and place 2 should be kept in num_zeros and initialise carry=array[num_zeros]
- mulitply int(digit1) and int(digit2) and add to carry
- now last digit of product by %10
- array[num_zeros+1]= //10 in next digit place
- after for loop pop 0 if present in last digit of array
- reverse the numbers and return as string

Steps of the solution like you’d explain to a friend.

## 5) Code (final)

```python
class Solution:
    def multiply(self, num1: str, num2: str) -> str:
        if num1=="0" or num2=="0":
            return "0"
        N=len(num1)+len(num2)
        answers=[0]*N
        first_number=num1[::-1]
        second_number=num2[::-1]
        for place2, digit2 in enumerate(second_number):
            for place1, digit1 in enumerate(first_number):
                num_zeros=place1+place2
                carry=answers[num_zeros]
                product=int(digit1)*int(digit2)+carry
                answers[num_zeros]=product%10
                answers[num_zeros+1]+=product//10

        if answers[-1]==0:
            answers.pop()
        return "".join(str(digit) for digit in reversed(answers))
