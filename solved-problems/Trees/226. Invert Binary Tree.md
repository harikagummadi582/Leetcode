# 226. Invert Binary Tree

**LeetCode:** {https://leetcode.com/problems/invert-binary-tree/description/}  
**Date:** {2026-01-23}  
**Status:** ✅ Solved
**Difficulty:** Easy
**Tags/Pattern:** {Trees}  
**Time/Space:** O(n) / O(h) where h is the height of the tree

## 1) Problem in 1 line

move right nodes of the tree to left and left to right
Explain the problem in one sentence.

---

## 2) My first thought (before coding)

What I tried first, and why.

---

## 3) Mistakes / Confusions (Error Notebook 핵심)

- Mistake #1: if not root didnt know what to return
- Mistake #2:
- What I learned:
  if not root return None

---

## 4) Final approach (in plain English)

if not root return None
swap nodes using self
use function given to call root.left and root.right one after other
return root
Steps of the solution like you’d explain to a friend.

## 5) Code (final)

```python
# Definition for a binary tree node.
# class TreeNode:
#     def __init__(self, val=0, left=None, right=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.left = left
#         self.right = right
class Solution:
    def invertTree(self, root: Optional[TreeNode]) -> Optional[TreeNode]:
        if not root:
            return None

        root.left, root.right=root.right,root.left
        self.invertTree(root.left)
        self.invertTree(root.right)
        return root
# paste final accepted code here
```
