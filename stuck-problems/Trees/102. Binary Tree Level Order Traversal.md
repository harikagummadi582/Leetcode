## 1) Problem in 1 line

new level new array in the list to store these values
Explain the problem in one sentence.

---

## 2) My first thought (before coding)

i wanted to track depth was sure about that so thought of using helper function but bases cases wasnt sure and how to append into the list according to the level
What I tried first, and why.

---

## 3) Mistakes / Confusions (Error Notebook 핵심)

- Mistake #1: base cases; backtracking working not sure
- Mistake #2: len(res)==depth then append new array - didnt click
- What I learned:
- backtracking, depth usage to append the list with node values according to the level

---

## 4) Final approach (in plain English)

- take a list res=[]
- define helper function with node, depth
- if not node return none so this is when backtracking can happen
- if len of res == depth then append [] to res
- out of if res[depth].append(node.val) this is to append node values at correct position
- call helper with root.left, depth+1 // careful how depth varies when you are backtracking here
- call helper with root.right, depth+1
  Steps of the solution like you’d explain to a friend.

## 5) Code (final)

```python
# Definition for a binary tree node.
# class TreeNode:
#     def __init__(self, val=0, left=None, right=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.left = left
#         self.right = right
class Solution:
    def levelOrder(self, root: Optional[TreeNode]) -> List[List[int]]:
        res=[]
        def search(node,depth):
            if not node:
                return None
            if len(res)==depth:
                res.append([])
            res[depth].append(node.val)
            search(node.left,depth+1)
            search(node.right,depth+1)
        search(root,0)
        return res
