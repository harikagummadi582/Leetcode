## 1) Problem in 1 line

mirror view should be same
Explain the problem in one sentence.

## 2) My first thought (before coding)

helper function with p,q initialised by root, edge cases of p,q and check if p,q values are same else false. call helper with p.left, q.right and next p.right, q.left
What I tried first, and why.

---

## 3) Mistakes / Confusions (Error Notebook 핵심)

- Mistake #1: check if node values not same return false
- Mistake #2: return true irrespective at the end
- What I learned:
- return helper function calls with and in between inside helper function
- return helper function call with root as p and q called

---

## 4) Final approach (in plain English)

- We write a helper same(p, q) that checks whether two subtrees are mirror images of each other.
- If both nodes are missing, they match. If only one is missing, they don’t.
- If both exist, their values must be equal and their children must match in a mirror way:
- left of p with right of q
- right of p with left of q
- We start by comparing the tree with itself (same(root, root)), which checks the left and right sides.
  Steps of the solution like you’d explain to a friend.

## 5) Code (final)

```python
# Definition for a binary tree node.
# class TreeNode:
#     def __init__(self, val=0, left=None, right=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.left = left
#         self.right = right
class Solution:
    def isSymmetric(self, root: Optional[TreeNode]) -> bool:
        def same(p,q):
            if not p and not q:
                return True
            if not p or not q:
                return False
            if p.val!=q.val:
                return False
            return same(p.left, q.right) and same(p.right,q.left)
        return same(root,root)
