# 21. Merge Two Sorted Lists

**LeetCode:** {https://leetcode.com/problems/merge-two-sorted-lists/description/}  
**Date:** {2026-01-21}  
**Status:** ❌ Stuck / 🔁 Redo  
**Difficulty:** Easy  
**Tags/Pattern:** {linked lists}  
**Time/Space:** O(n+m) / O(1)

## 1) Problem in 1 line

merge both the lists based on the node values in increasing order
Explain the problem in one sentence.

---

## 2) My first thought (before coding)

i checked if one list exists and not other list return the existing one.
checked the node values and add the remaining list
What I tried first, and why.

---

## 3) Mistakes / Confusions (Error Notebook 핵심)

- Mistake #1: i was modifying the current lists without considering a new list
- Mistake #2: did not increment the pointers so led to TLE
- What I learned:
- consider dummy and curr for a new list- dummy=ListNode(-1), curr=dummy and return dummy.next at the end
- list1.val for comparing the node values

---

## 4) Final approach (in plain English)

- take dummy node and curr
- check single lists existense
- while list1 and list2 exist compare the node values
- before returning dummy.next add if there is any list remaining to the new list being created.
  Steps of the solution like you’d explain to a friend.

## 5) Code (final)

```python
# Definition for singly-linked list.
# class ListNode:
#     def __init__(self, val=0, next=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.next = next
class Solution:
    def mergeTwoLists(self, list1: Optional[ListNode], list2: Optional[ListNode]) -> Optional[ListNode]:
        # we need seperate list so use dummy
        #updating the pointers?
        dummy=ListNode(-1)
        curr=dummy
        if list1 and not list2:
            return list1
        if list2 and not list1:
            return list2
        while list1 and list2:
            if list1.val<=list2.val:
                curr.next=list1
                list1=list1.next
            else:
                curr.next=list2
                list2=list2.next
            curr=curr.next
        if list1:
            curr.next=list1
            return dummy.next
        if list2:
            curr.next=list2
            return dummy.next
# paste final accepted code here
```
