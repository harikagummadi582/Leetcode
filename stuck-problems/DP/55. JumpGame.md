**Difficulty:** Medium
**Tags/Pattern:** {arrays, greedy}  
**Time/Space:** O(n) / O(1)

## 1) Problem in 1 line

based on jumps value at every index you should see if you can reach the last index by optimising how jump vlaues can be used
Explain the problem in one sentence.

---

## 2) My first thought (before coding)

no idea
What I tried first, and why.

---

## 3) Mistakes / Confusions (Error Notebook 핵심)

- Mistake #1: should know template to approch greedy, dp problems

---

## 4) Final approach (in plain English)

- 1️⃣ Start with max_reach = 0 to track the farthest index you can reach.
- 2️⃣ Walk through the array from left to right.
- 3️⃣ If your current index is beyond max_reach, you’re stuck → return False. 👉 “I’m trying to stand at position i… but I can’t even reach it.” If you can’t stand there, you can’t jump from there.
- 4️⃣ Otherwise update reach using max_reach = max(max_reach, i + nums[i]).
- 5️⃣ If you finish the loop (or reach the last index), you can reach the end → return True.
  Steps of the solution like you’d explain to a friend.

## 5) Code (final)

```python
class Solution:
    def canJump(self, nums: List[int]) -> bool:
        max_reach=0
        last=len(nums)-1

        for i, jump in enumerate(nums):
            #smaller max reach at the index
            if i>max_reach:
                return False
            max_reach=max(max_reach, i+jump)
            #at index max_reach number is greater or equal to last index
            if max_reach>=last:
                return True
        return True
