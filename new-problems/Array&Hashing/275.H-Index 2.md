**Date:** {2026-02-05}  
**Status:** ✅ Solved  
**Difficulty:** Medium  
**Tags/Pattern:** {arrays}  
**Time/Space:** O(n log n) / O(1)

## 1) Problem in 1 line

- find max value of h so that there are atleast h number of paper each having h citations
  Explain the problem in one sentence.

---

## 2) My first thought (before coding)

- sorted the array and saw if each array value from the start>=index+1 to get the max value
  What I tried first, and why.

## 3) Mistakes / Confusions (Error Notebook 핵심)

---

## 4) Final approach (in plain English)

- First, we sort the citation counts in descending order so the most-cited papers come first.
- Then we go through the list one paper at a time, keeping track of how many papers we’ve checked so far.
- At index i, we ask: “Does this paper have at least i + 1 citations?”
- If yes, that means we have i + 1 papers with at least i + 1 citations, so we update our answer.
- We keep going, and the last valid count we stored is the h-index we return.
  Steps of the solution like you’d explain to a friend.

## 5) Code (final)

```python
class Solution:
    def hIndex(self, citations: List[int]) -> int:
        citations.sort(reverse=True)
        print(citations)
        c=0
        for i in range(len(citations)):
            if citations[i]>=i+1:
                c=i+1
        return c
