## 1) Problem in 1 line

- i have to find the roman equivalant to the given number
  Explain the problem in one sentence.

---

## 2) My first thought (before coding)

- no idea
  What I tried first, and why.

---

## 3) Mistakes / Confusions (Error Notebook 핵심)

- What I learned: usage of divmod function

---

## 4) Final approach (in plain English)

- Start with the biggest Roman values (1000, 900, 500…) because Roman numbers are built from large chunks first.
- For each value, see how many times it fits into the number (using division/divmod inbuilt function).
- Add that symbol those many times to your answer string.
- Subtract that amount from the number and move to the next smaller value.
- Keep repeating until the number becomes 0.

Steps of the solution like you’d explain to a friend.

## 5) Code (final)

```python
class Solution:
    def intToRoman(self, num: int) -> str:
        digits=[
            (1000, "M"),
            (900, "CM"),
            (500, "D"),
            (400, "CD"),
            (100, "C"),
            (90, "XC"),
            (50, "L"),
            (40, "XL"),
            (10, "X"),
            (9, "IX"),
            (5, "V"),
            (4, "IV"),
            (1, "I"),
        ]
        roman_digits=[]
        for value,symbol in digits:
            count,num=divmod(num,value)
            roman_digits.append(symbol*count)

        return "".join(roman_digits)
