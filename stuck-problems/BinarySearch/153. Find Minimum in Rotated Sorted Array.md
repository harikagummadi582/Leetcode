# 153. Find Minimum in Rotated Sorted Array

**LeetCode:** {https://leetcode.com/problems/find-minimum-in-rotated-sorted-array/description/}  
**Date:** {2026-01-21}  
**Status:** ❌ Stuck / 🔁 Redo  
**Difficulty:** Medium  
**Tags/Pattern:** binary search
**Time/Space:** O(log n) / O(1)

## 1) Problem in 1 line

find the min element and the numbers are not in order as they are rotated but ascending order
Explain the problem in one sentence.

---

## 2) My first thought (before coding)

i have to do binary serach and make left=mid+1, right=mid and return nums[left]
What I tried first, and why.

---

## 3) Mistakes / Confusions (Error Notebook 핵심)

- Mistake #1: i did not know how to manipulate the binary search logic. i took nums[mid]>left else nums[mid]>=right
- What I learned:
  i should manipulate nums[mid]>nums[right] to manipulate left and else to do right as else covers rest of the scenarios

---

## 4) Final approach (in plain English)

- take left and right at inital and last element of the array
- take mid inside for loop
- now compare the mid and right to manipulate left=mid+1
- now else to manipulate the right=mid
- return nums[left]
  Steps of the solution like you’d explain to a friend.

## 5) Code (final)

```python
class Solution:
    def findMin(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        left=0
        right=len(nums)-1
        while left<right:
            mid=(left+right)//2
            if nums[mid]>nums[right]:
                left=mid+1
            else:
                right=mid
        return nums[left]
