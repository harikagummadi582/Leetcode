## 1) Problem in 1 line

find min difference between any two nodes in the tree.
Explain the problem in one sentence.

---

## 2) My first thought (before coding)

- was tracking min val node entirely with every node.val and finiding min diff
  What I tried first, and why.

---

## 3) Mistakes / Confusions (Error Notebook 핵심)

- Mistake #1: missed inorder has nodes sorted and the min diff would be between two adjacent nodes
- What I learned:
- use of nonlocal keyword when variables defined outside the helper function

---

## 4) Final approach (in plain English)

- take prev as None, ans=float('inf)
- helper function where you do inorder traversal and if prev not none then find ans the min of ans and node.val-prev
- outside if assign node value to prev
- call helper function
- return ans
  Steps of the solution like you’d explain to a friend.

## 5) Code (final)

```python
# Definition for a binary tree node.
# class TreeNode:
#     def __init__(self, val=0, left=None, right=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.left = left
#         self.right = right
class Solution:
    def getMinimumDifference(self, root: Optional[TreeNode]) -> int:
        prev=None
        ans=float('inf')
        def inorder(node):
            nonlocal prev,ans
            if not node:
                return
            inorder(node.left)
            if prev is not None:
                ans=min(ans, node.val-prev)
            prev=node.val
            inorder(node.right)
        inorder(root)
        return ans

```
