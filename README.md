# LeetCode Error Notebook 🧠💻

This repository is my personal system to master LeetCode by:
- Logging **mistakes**, not just solutions
- Using **spaced repetition**
- Learning **patterns**, not random problems
- Staying consistent with **small daily commits**

## How I solve & log each problem
1. Create a markdown file for the problem
2. Write my first thoughts and mistakes
3. Add the final approach and code
4. Schedule redo days (Day +1 / +3 / +7 / +14)
5. Commit — even tiny progress counts

## Core philosophy
> Don’t grind harder. Grind smarter.

Consistency > perfection.
