## 1) Problem in 1 line

reverse the given linked list
Explain the problem in one sentence.

---

## 2) My first thought (before coding)

i wanted to assign curr=head, prev=None, while curr but was again confused to write the logic
What I tried first, and why.

---

## 3) Mistakes / Confusions (Error Notebook 핵심)

- Mistake #1: forgot how to move pointers forward
- What I learned:
- save the link, reverse the link, move prev forward, move curr forward

---

## 4) Final approach (in plain English)

- nxt=curr.next
- curr.next=prev
- prev=curr
- curr=nxt
- return prev
  Steps of the solution like you’d explain to a friend.

## 5) Code (final)

```python
# Definition for singly-linked list.
# class ListNode:
#     def __init__(self, val=0, next=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.next = next
class Solution:
    def reverseList(self, head: Optional[ListNode]) -> Optional[ListNode]:
        if head is []:
            return []

        prev=None
        curr=head
        while curr:
            nxt=curr.next #save the link
            curr.next=prev #link made none
            prev=curr #move prev forward
            curr=nxt #move curr forward
        return prev
# paste final accepted code here
```
