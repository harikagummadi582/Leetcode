## 1) Problem in 1 line

remove elements appearing more than twice, make the order of the nums stay same and return the final length of the list
Explain the problem in one sentence.

---

## 2) My first thought (before coding)

i wanted to use map to track count but not sure how to remove elements when freq is greater than 2
What I tried first, and why.

---

## 3) Mistakes / Confusions (Error Notebook 핵심)

- Mistake #1: removing element from the list not known
- What I learned:
  list.remove(list[i])- to remove particular element from the list

---

## 4) Final approach (in plain English)

- initiate pointer, map
- write a while loop where pointer is less than length of the input list
- inside while loop populate map and iterate pointer
- when freq of ele is greater than 2 remove the element from the list
- return length of the list as the final answer
  Steps of the solution like you’d explain to a friend.

---

## 5) Code (final)

```python
class Solution:
    def removeDuplicates(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        i=0
        map={}
        while i<len(nums):
            if nums[i] not in map:
                map[nums[i]]=1
                i=i+1
            else:
                map[nums[i]]+=1
                if map[nums[i]]>2:
                    nums.remove(nums[i])
                else:
                    i=i+1
        return len(nums)

```
