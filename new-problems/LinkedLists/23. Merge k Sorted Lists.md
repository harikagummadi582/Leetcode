# 23. Merge k Sorted Lists

**LeetCode:** {https://leetcode.com/problems/merge-k-sorted-lists/description/?envType=company&envId=two-sigma&favoriteSlug=two-sigma-all}  
**Date:** {2026-01-22}  
**Status:** ❌ Stuck / 🔁 Redo  
**Difficulty:** Hard  
**Tags/Pattern:** {Linked Lists}  
**Time/Space:** O(N log k) / O(k)
Each of the N nodes is pushed to and popped from a heap of size at most k, so total time is O(N log k). The heap stores at most k nodes at any time, so the extra space used is O(k).

## 1) Problem in 1 line

Merge k sorted linked lists into one sorted linked list efficiently.
Explain the problem in one sentence.

---

## 2) My first thought (before coding)

thought of comapring each first element in the array and doing it
What I tried first, and why.

---

## 3) Mistakes / Confusions (Error Notebook 핵심)

- Mistake #1:
- Mistake #2:
- What I learned:

---

## 4) Final approach (in plain English)

- Put the first node of every linked list into a min-heap so we can always see the smallest value.
- Repeatedly take the smallest node from the heap and attach it to the result list.
- When a node is taken from a list, put its next node into the heap.
- Keep doing this until the heap is empty and all nodes are merged into one sorted list.
  Steps of the solution like you’d explain to a friend.

## 5) Code (final)

````python
# Definition for singly-linked list.
# class ListNode:
#     def __init__(self, val=0, next=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.next = next
class HeapNode:
    def __init__(self,node):
        self.node=node
    def __lt__ (self,other):
        return self.node.val < other.node.val

class Solution:
    def mergeKLists(self, lists: List[Optional[ListNode]]) -> Optional[ListNode]:
        dummy=ListNode(0)
        current=dummy
        heap=[]

        for l in lists:
            if l:
                heapq.heappush(heap, HeapNode(l)) #push one list at once
        while heap:
            heap_node=heapq.heappop(heap) #HeapNode(1)
            node=heap_node.node #Give me the ListNode stored inside this HeapNode
            current.next=node
            current=current.next
            if node.next:
                heapq.heappush(heap,HeapNode(node.next))
        return dummy.next






#BRUTE FORCE
```python
#head for this list
        #point to traverse through the final list created
        point=head=ListNode(0)
        nodes=[]
        for l in lists:
            #for each list in lists
            while l:
                nodes.append(l.val)
                l=l.next

        for x in sorted(nodes):
            #making int values into nodes
            point.next=ListNode(x)
            point=point.next
        return head.next
