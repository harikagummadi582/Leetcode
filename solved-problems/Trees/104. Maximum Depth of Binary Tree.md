# 104. Maximum Depth of Binary Tree

**LeetCode:** {https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-depth-of-binary-tree/description/}  
**Date:** {2026-01-23}  
**Status:** ✅ Solved  
**Difficulty:** Easy
**Tags/Pattern:** {trees}  
**Time/Space:** O(n) / O(h)

## 1) Problem in 1 line

find max depth possible in the tree
Explain the problem in one sentence.

---

## 2) My first thought (before coding)

What I tried first, and why.

---

## 3) Mistakes / Confusions (Error Notebook 핵심)

- Mistake #1: i returned if not root return None but the output format is int so return 0
- Mistake #2:
- What I learned:
  look at output format when using return

---

## 4) Final approach (in plain English)

if not root return 0
return 1+ max(left depth from root, right depth from root)
Steps of the solution like you’d explain to a friend.

---

## 5) Code (final)

```python
# Definition for a binary tree node.
# class TreeNode:
#     def __init__(self, val=0, left=None, right=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.left = left
#         self.right = right
class Solution:
    def maxDepth(self, root: Optional[TreeNode]) -> int:
        if not root:
            return 0 #output is int
        return 1+ max(self.maxDepth(root.left), self.maxDepth(root.right))

# paste final accepted code here
```
