# 347. Top K Freq Elements

**LeetCode:** https://leetcode.com/problems/top-k-frequent-elements/description/  
**Date:** {2026-01-14} , {2026-02-02}
**Status:** ❌ Stuck / 🔁 Redo  
**Difficulty:** Medium  
**Tags/Pattern:** {e.g., Hashing, Set}  
**Time/Space:** O(n + m log m + k) / O(m + k) where m is items in map and k is input given = len of output

## 1) Problem in 1 line

the top k most frequent elements to be returned
2nd attempt- did not remember the syntax
Explain the problem in one sentence.

---

## 2) My first thought (before coding)

i tried to track frequencies through map
i wanted to sort but didnt know the syntax to sort map values in reverse
wanted to have for loop to return most k freq but was trying to get freq out and not numbers
What I tried first, and why.

## 3) Mistakes / Confusions (Error Notebook 핵심)

- Mistake #1: syntax to sort map values in reverse
- Mistake #2:didnt know how to access map items only
- What I learned:
  > > lambda is used as a function for ex here
  > > def lambda(x):
      return x[1]
  > > syntax to sort map values in reverse - sorted_map=sorted(freq_map.items(),key=lambda x:x[1], reverse True)
  > > return all key value pairs in map - freq_map.items()

---

## 4) Final approach (in plain English)

create a frequency map
create a for loop to add frequencies into the map based on numbers
sort acc to the values in the map
create for loop to get items of first k freq elements and add them to an array
Steps of the solution like you’d explain to a friend.

## 5) Code (final)

```python
class Solution:
    def topKFrequent(self, nums: List[int], k: int) -> List[int]:
        freq_map={}
        res=[]
        for num in nums:
            if num not in freq_map:
                freq_map[num]=1
            else:
                freq_map[num]+=1
        sorted_map=sorted(freq_map.items(), key=lambda x:x[1], reverse=True)
        for i in range(k):
            res.append(sorted_map[i][0])
        return res
