# 19. Remove Nth Node From End of List

**LeetCode:** {https://leetcode.com/problems/remove-nth-node-from-end-of-list/description/}  
**Date:** {2026-01-22}  
**Status:** ❌ Stuck / 🔁 Redo  
**Difficulty:** Medium
**Tags/Pattern:** {linked lists}  
**Time/Space:** O(n) / O(1)

## 1) Problem in 1 line

should delete the nth node from the end and return the new list
Explain the problem in one sentence.

## 2) My first thought (before coding)

slow, fast pointers yes but not more than that
What I tried first, and why.

## 3) Mistakes / Confusions (Error Notebook 핵심)

- Mistake #1: while fast only and not fast and fast.next traverse to know why - this is important
- Mistake #2: range(n+1) runs n+1 times
- What I learned:
- take dummy variable as the head is the one that want to be deleted
- dummy=ListNode(0, head), slow=dummy, fast=dummy
- take for loop to get fast where you want and traverse through while to have nth node in between fast and slow as that how fast and slow work based on the while you write
- to delete a node for ex node.next=node.next.next

---

## 4) Final approach (in plain English)

- take dummy node and assign it value 0th position and head to point towards as head might want to be deleted
- assign dummy to slow and fast pointers
- take for loop for fast to do fast=fast.next for n+1 times
- while fast: move slow and fast as .next
- after while you will have slow at n+1 position from the end so do slow.next=slow.next.next
- return dummy.next as thats where the list starts
  Steps of the solution like you’d explain to a friend.

## 5) Code (final)

```python
# Definition for singly-linked list.
# class ListNode:
#     def __init__(self, val=0, next=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.next = next
class Solution:
    def removeNthFromEnd(self, head: Optional[ListNode], n: int) -> Optional[ListNode]:
        dummy=ListNode(0, head)
        slow=dummy
        fast=dummy
        for i in range(n+1):
            fast=fast.next
        while fast:
            fast=fast.next
            slow=slow.next
        slow.next=slow.next.next
        return dummy.next
# paste final accepted code here
```
